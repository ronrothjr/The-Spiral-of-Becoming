# **A Primer for Thread Discovery**

### **How to Recognize a Universal Thread**

A thread might be universal if:

* You find it appearing across multiple wisdom traditions (differently expressed)  
* It represents a tension that can't be permanently resolved  
* It shows up in both individual and collective experience  
* Children naturally encounter it without being taught  
* It generates creative energy when held consciously  
* Avoiding it creates stagnation or suffering

### **The Thread Discovery Process**

**1\. Notice Recurring Tensions** What conflicts keep appearing in different forms? What questions do you return to throughout life?

**2\. Feel the Poles** What are the two (or more) truths pulling against each other? Name them without choosing sides.

**3\. Find the Universal** Strip away specific context. What's the deeper pattern? What would someone in any culture recognize?

**4\. Locate the Creative Edge** Where does this tension generate energy rather than paralysis? What becomes possible by holding both/all sides?

**5\. Test Across Difference** Does this resonate across:

* Generations?  
* Cultures?  
* Belief systems?  
* Life experiences?

## **Examples of Potential Additional Threads**

### **POWER**
**Seed:** "Who shapes reality?"

**Tension:** _Agency vs. Structure_

**Questions:**
* Who decides what's possible and what's not?
* When is power generative and when is it oppressive?
* How do we redistribute power without reproducing domination?
* What's the relationship between personal and systemic power?
* When do we resist and when do we build alternatives?

### **WITNESS**
**Seed:** "What must be named?"

**Tension:** _Comfort vs. Truth_
 
**Questions:**
* When do we speak and when do we listen?
* What requires denunciation and what requires annunciation?
* Who are we called to comfort and who to challenge?
* How do we witness suffering without consuming it?
* What prophecy does this moment demand?

### **RECIPROCITY**
**Seed:** "What's in an exchange?"

**Tension:** _Giving vs. Receiving_

**Questions:**
* How do we maintain balance in exchange?
* When is giving depleting and receiving greedy?  
* What circulates through us rather than from us?

### **THRESHOLD**
**Seed:** "What makes us whole?"

**Tension:** _Inside vs. Outside_, _Us vs. Them_

**Questions:**
* Where do boundaries serve and where do they separate?  
* How do we honor containers while allowing flow?  
* What guards the doorway and what crosses it?

### **RHYTHM**
**Seed:** "How do we live?"

**Tension:** _Repetition vs. Variation_

**Questions:**
* How do patterns both sustain and imprison?  
* When does routine become ritual become rut?  
* What wants to stay the same and what wants to change?
